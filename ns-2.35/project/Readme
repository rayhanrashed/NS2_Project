Record the design idea & simulation skill

2009, Jul. 3, Friday, Qiu Qinlong:
1) debug segmentation fault
   - with the simplest code compare the original working SW
   - e.g. LTEQueue --> DropTail
2) be carful with point, especially with point=NULL
3) testing script is very helpful

simulation:
 - 60 seconds
 - 10 subscribers
 - 5 classes' traffic
 - classification and scheduling

working SW: 
 - project/lte.tcl
 - project/ltequeue.cc
 - project/ltequeue.h
 - queue/drop-tail.h
 - queue/red.h
 - tcl/webcache/http-agent.tcl
 - tcl/webcache/http-cache.tcl
 - tcl/webcache/http-server.tcl
 - tcl/rtp/session-rtp.tcl

next step:
 - configure 5 classes' Queue parameters, such as limit_
 - cofigure application parameters
 - do the statistics
 - comparing test
 - write paper

other useful files:
 - tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl
 - project/*.cc, *.h, test

The following comand sometimes can solve very difficult problem, such as memory corrupted!
	- make clean;
	- make;

Class A {
public: virtual void print(){};
friend class B;
protected: int a;
};// The ";" is a must, otherwise, there will be very strange compile error.

Class B {
A *a=new A;
a->a; //class B can use class A's protected member due to B is A's friend class.
};

Class C: public A {
public : virtual void print(){};
};

A *p, *q;
p = new A;
q = new C;
p->print();//class A's print
q->print();//class B's print
//if without virtual, q->print will be A's print.

When using REDQueue, Queue/RED set q_weight_ 0.002 to avoid floating error!
